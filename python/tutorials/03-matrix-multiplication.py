Matrix Multiplication
=====================
In this tutorial, you will write a 25-lines high-performance FP16 matrix multiplication
kernel that achieves performance on par with cuBLAS.

In doing so, you will learn about:
- Block-level matrix multiplications
- Multi-dimensional pointer arithmetic
- Program re-ordering for improved L2 cache hit rate
- Automatic performance tuning
"""

# %%
# Motivations
# -----------
#
# Matrix multiplications are a key building block of most modern high-performance computing systems.
# They are notoriously hard to optimize, hence their implementation is generally done by
# hardware vendors themselves as part of so-called "kernel libraries" (e.g., cuBLAS).
# Unfortunately, these libraries are often proprietary and cannot be easily customized
# to accommodate the needs of modern deep learning workloads (e.g., fused activation functions).
# In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement efficient matrix multiplications by
# yourself with Triton, in a way that is easy to customize and extend.
#
# Roughly speaking, the kernel that we will write will implement the following blocked
# algorithm to multiply a (M, K) by a (K, N) matrix:
#
#  .. code-block:: python
#
#    # do in parallel
#    for m in range(0, M, BLOCK_SIZE_M):
#      # do in parallel
#      for n in range(0, N, BLOCK_SIZE_N):
#        acc = zeros((BLOCK_SIZE_M, BLOCK_SIZE_N), dtype=float32)
#        for k in range(0, K, BLOCK_SIZE_K):
#          a = A[m : m+BLOCK_SIZE_M, k : k+BLOCK_SIZE_K]
#          b = B[k : k+BLOCK_SIZE_K, n : n+BLOCK_SIZE_N]
#          acc += dot(a, b)
#        C[m : m+BLOCK_SIZE_M, n : n+BLOCK_SIZE_N] = acc;
#
# where each iteration of the doubly-nested for-loop is performed by a dedicated Triton program instance.

# %%
# Compute Kernel
# --------------
#
# The above algorithm is, actually, fairly straightforward to implement in Triton.
# The main difficulty comes from the computation of the memory locations at which blocks
# of :code:`A` and :code:`B` must be read in the inner loop. For that, we need
# multi-dimensional pointer arithmetic.
#
#
# Pointer Arithmetic
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# For a row-major 2D tensor :code:`X`, the memory location of :code:`X[i, j]` is given b
# y :code:`&X[i, j] = X + i*stride_xi + j*stride_xj`.
# Therefore, blocks of pointers for :code:`A[m : m+BLOCK_SIZE_M, k:k+BLOCK_SIZE_K]` and
# :code:`B[k : k+BLOCK_SIZE_K, n : n+BLOCK_SIZE_N]` can be defined in pseudo-code as:
#
#  .. code-block:: python
#
#    &A[m : m+BLOCK_SIZE_M, k:k+BLOCK_SIZE_K] =  a_ptr + (m : m+BLOCK_SIZE_M)[:, None]*A.stride(0) + (k : k+BLOCK_SIZE_K)[None, :]*A.stride(1);
#    &B[k : k+BLOCK_SIZE_K, n:n+BLOCK_SIZE_N] =  b_ptr + (k : k+BLOCK_SIZE_K)[:, None]*B.stride(0) + (n : n+BLOCK_SIZE_N)[None, :]*B.stride(1);
#
# Which means that pointers for blocks of A and B can be initialized (i.e., :code:`k=0`) in Triton as:
#
#  .. code-block:: python
#
#    offs_am = pid_m * BLOCK_SIZE_M + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_M)
#    offs_bn = pid_n * BLOCK_SIZE_N + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_N)
#    offs_k = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_K)
#    a_ptrs = a_ptr + (offs_am[:, None]*stride_am + offs_k [None, :]*stride_ak)
#    b_ptrs = b_ptr + (offs_k [:, None]*stride_bk + offs_bn[None, :]*stride_bn)
#
# And then updated in the inner loop as follows:
#
#  .. code-block:: python
#
#    a_ptrs += BLOCK_SIZE_K * stride_ak;
#    b_ptrs += BLOCK_SIZE_K * stride_bk;
#
#
# L2 Cache Optimizations
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As mentioned above, each program instance computes a :code:`[BLOCK_SIZE_M, BLOCK_SIZE_N]`
# block of :code:`C`.
# It is important to remember that the order in which these blocks are computed does
# matter, since it affects the L2 cache hit rate of our program. and unfortunately, a
# a simple row-major ordering
#
#  .. code-block:: Python
#
#    pid = triton.program_id(0);
#    grid_m = (M + BLOCK_SIZE_M - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_M;
#    grid_n = (N + BLOCK_SIZE_N - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_N;
#    pid_m = pid / grid_n;
#    pid_n = pid % grid_n;
#
# is just not going to cut it.
#
# One possible solution is to launch blocks in an order that promotes data reuse.
# This can be done by 'super-grouping' blocks in groups of :code:`GROUP_M` rows before
# switching to the next column:
#
#  .. code-block:: python
#
#    # program ID
#    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
#    # number of program ids along the M axis
#    num_pid_m = tl.cdiv(M, BLOCK_SIZE_M)
#    # number of programs ids along the N axis
#    num_pid_n = tl.cdiv(N, BLOCK_SIZE_N)
#    # number of programs in group
#    num_pid_in_group = GROUP_SIZE_M * num_pid_n
#    # id of the group this program is in
#    group_id = pid // num_pid_in_group
#    # row-id of the first program in the group
#    first_pid_m = group_id * GROUP_SIZE_M
#    # if `num_pid_m` isn't divisible by `GROUP_SIZE_M`, the last group is smaller
#    group_size_m = min(num_pid_m - first_pid_m, GROUP_SIZE_M)
#    # *within groups*, programs are ordered in a column-major order
#    # row-id of the program in the *launch grid*
#    pid_m = first_pid_m + (pid % group_size_m)
#    # col-id of the program in the *launch grid*
#    pid_n = (pid % num_pid_in_group) // group_size_m
#
# For example, in the following matmul where each matrix is 9 blocks by 9 blocks,
# we can see that if we compute the output in row-major ordering, we need to load 90
# blocks into SRAM to compute the first 9 output blocks, but if we do it in grouped
# ordering, we only need to load 54 blocks.
#   .. image:: grouped_vs_row_major_ordering.png
#
# In practice, this can improve the performance of our matrix multiplication kernel by
# more than 10\% on some hardware architecture (e.g., 220 to 245 TFLOPS on A100).
